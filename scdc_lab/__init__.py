"""SCDC Lab: Consistency-first emergent physics toolkit.

This package implements:
- Finite relational worlds (graphs + local rules)
- SCDC closure (admissibility, star-equivariance, diamond confluence)
- Quotient dynamics Λ⋆ and schedule-independent simulation
- Emergent spacetime diagnostics on condensation DAGs
- Emergent matter diagnostics via autonomous pockets
- Discrete-geodesic / lensing / deviation probes driven by the same consistency outputs

Designed to support research workflows and reproducible experiments.
